# Insights and Recommendations — HR Attrition Analysis

## Business Question
What factors are most associated with employee attrition, and what actions can HR leadership take to reduce avoidable turnover?

---

## Key Insights (What the data suggests)
1. **Overtime is strongly associated with attrition**
   - Employees working overtime show noticeably higher attrition than those who do not.
   - This suggests workload, burnout, or role expectations may be driving departures.

2. **Attrition varies significantly by job role**
   - Certain roles have disproportionately higher attrition rates.
   - This indicates role-specific pressures, career path concerns, or compensation gaps.

3. **Department-level differences exist**
   - Some departments experience higher turnover than others.
   - This can reflect management practices, workload distribution, or limited mobility.

4. **Lower satisfaction and compensation align with higher attrition**
   - Employees with lower job satisfaction and lower monthly income are more likely to leave.
   - This reinforces the importance of engagement and competitive pay for retention.

## Recommendations (What to do next)
1. **Target overtime-heavy teams with workload interventions**
   - Rebalance staffing, reduce recurring overtime, and review scheduling practices.
   - Add manager-level monitoring for sustained overtime patterns.

2. **Role-specific retention strategies**
   - For high-attrition roles: review job expectations, training/onboarding quality, and advancement pathways.
   - Use stay interviews for those roles to detect early risk signals.

3. **Department reviews**
   - For departments with higher attrition: audit management practices, employee feedback themes, and workload allocation.
   - Compare high-retention vs high-attrition departments to identify best practices.

4. **Compensation and engagement actions**
   - Benchmark pay bands for high-attrition roles.
   - Improve recognition, feedback cadence, and career development planning.

## Limitations
- This analysis identifies **associations**, not proven causation.
- Some factors may be proxies (e.g., overtime may reflect role type or operational seasonality).
- Results depend on data quality and the features available in the dataset.

## Next Steps
- Add statistical testing or modeling (logistic regression) to quantify the impact of key drivers.
- Segment analysis by tenure bands to refine targeted retention actions.
- Track attrition outcomes after policy or workload changes to evaluate impact.
